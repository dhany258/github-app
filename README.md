# GitHub List User

Discover my Kotlin-based Android application that integrates seamlessly with the GitHub API. This app utilizes Data Access Object (DAO) for efficient data handling and features a 'favorite user' functionality for easy access to preferred GitHub profiles. The Retrofit library is employed to fetch data from the API, ensuring reliable and efficient network communication. Working on this project honed my skills in API integration and efficient data management in Android development.

## Features

- **GitHub List User**: Browse through a list of GitHub users.
- **Search User**: Quickly find GitHub users by their username.
- **Profile Details**: View detailed information about each GitHub user.
- **Favorite GitHub Users**: Easily manage and access your favorite GitHub profiles.
- **Theme Preferences**: Customize the app's appearance with theme preferences.
